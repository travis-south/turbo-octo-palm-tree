# Horse Race Betting System

## Overview

This project is a Django-based web application for simulating a betting system for horse races. It features real-time updates of race odds, allows users to place bets, and calculates dividends based on a tote betting system.

## Reviewer's note

FYI, This is not yet finished and not fully working (due to time constraint). This is using Django and DEF to provide the api and management. It has command that you will parse the csv file and process it based on the events. This also has Celery to handle all the async task. I have also added the docker and docker-compose to make it easier to run the project. I haven't added anything for monitoring but we are using Django's built-in logging and push it to a centralized logging system like ELK or Splunk.

## Features

- Real-time odds updates.
- Ability to place and track bets.
- Automatic calculation of dividends.
- Event-driven architecture with Celery (and channel if needed websocket).
- Asynchronous task processing with Celery.

   python manage.py runserver
   ```

   The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### Docker and Docker Compose

1. **Build and run docker-compose**

   ```bash
